It is inspiringto cooperate with <a href="https://eps.harvard.edu/people/duo-chan">Chris</a> and <a href="http://eddy.nju.edu.cn/yzhang/">Professor Zhang</a> on Inter-annual variability of the East Asian Jet Stream. The work will be submitted to submitted to J. Climate soon.

> Schematic diagram illustrating the dynamical processes responsible for the inter-annual variability in the intensity of the wintertime EAJS. Black counters denote the anomalous U200 denoting an intensified EAJS. Black arrows and red shadings denote anomalous transient eddy activities (E-vector and the divergence). Blue shadings denote anomalous tropical precipitation over Indian Ocean and West Pacific. Red thick arrows denote the two branches of the thermally direct meridional overturning circulations originated from the tropical Indian Ocean and West Pacific. The inter-annual variability of the EAJS is both thermally driven and eddy-driven.
