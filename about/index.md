## About This Blog

This blog is a clone from [GitHub](https://github.com/hanyihong0324/hanyihong0324.github.io), which is based on [Moon](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon), a jekyll theme that was opensourced with MIT license on GitHub.

Thanks to TaylanTatli, the developer of Moon, and hanyihong0324, who changed a lot of things to fit my needs. Details are post in his personal site: <a href="/Progressing_Personal_Site/">Progressing Personal Site</a>.
